# install instructions

## requirements:
- Fabric Loader
- Fabric API
- Fabric Language Kotlin

(ideally latest versions)

## setup
Just put the jar file, alongside the required mods, into the mods folder. The mod will then generate a config file, where you will have to enter a Discord Bot Token controlling a bot with message read/write permissions, as well as the channel and guild (server) ID where all messages should be relayed to and from. (aquireable within discord by enabling developer mode and right-clicking server/channel)
